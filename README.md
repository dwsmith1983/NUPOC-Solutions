This project is a work in progress. The aim is to provide comprehemsive solutions to Navy's NUPOC study guide. 

Presently all but one question in math has been answered and the physics section is complete. This doesn't mean every answer is perfect and error free.

Sections that need to be complete are Electrical Engineering, Chemistry, Thermodynamics, Mechanical Engineering, Fluids and Buoyancy, Materials and Civil Engineering, Statics and Dynamics, Atomic and Nuclear, and Other Questions.

Anyone who provides LaTeX solutions to any section will be created for their work. However, the LaTeX needs to be up to par with the present level of formatting. Feel free to peruse the the files all ready added to see how they are setup. Additionally, if a problem has a diagram or needs one in order to be solved, it will be expected that the picture is created in TikZ, pgf plots, asymptote, or some other LaTeX package.
